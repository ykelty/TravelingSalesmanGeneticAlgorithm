Objective: Implement a genetic algorithm to solve a 3D Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that minimizes the path distance between cities represented in 3D space.


Key Features:

	Initialize a population of random paths.

	Use genetic algorithm techniques:

  Parent selection via a roulette-wheel method.
	
	Two-point crossover for generating offspring.
 
	Mutation for diversity in solutions.
 
	Output the optimal path and total distance traveled.
